I want to build a traffic simulator where I can understand and learn how accidents impact the flow of traffic. Please research and work with me to create a plan for how you can model traffic, what's sota, what parameters matter, how to visualize, how to dynamically adjust stuff, etc. You can reuse as much existing work as you want

---

What is standard for dynamic traffic simulations for UI. I want something customizable and modular in case we decide to improve it over time
